abstract: Millimeter-wave and terahertz circuits have numerous applications in radars, remote sensing, and next-generation 5G networks. Among the THz radars, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) topology has drawn attention for imaging and security applications. Comparing the state-of-the-art FMCW radars, most wideband radars are implemented with costly SiGe HBT transistors with a fmax of 380GHz. Transistor scaling increases the fmax of low-cost CMOS technologies, which makes them suitable for high-precision imaging applications such as dental imaging that require wide bandwidth, compactness, and high operation frequency.
